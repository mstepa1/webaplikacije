		<p>Overwatch is a team-based multiplayer online first-person shooter video game developed and published by Blizzard Entertainment. It was released in May 2016 for Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. Overwatch assigns players into two teams of six, with each player selecting from a roster of 25 pre-defined characters, known as heroes, each with a unique style of play, whose roles are divided into four general categories: Offense, Defense, Tank, and Support. Players on a team work together to secure and defend control points on a map or escort a payload across the map in a limited amount of time. Players gain cosmetic rewards that do not affect gameplay, such as character skins and victory poses, as they play the game.</p>
		<p>In Overwatch, you control one of several heroes in competitive 6-person team shooting matches. Battle over objectives, take down the other team, and achieve victory</p>
		<p>Each hero has a primary attack or skill and at least two additional skills that can be invoked at any time, some requiring a brief cooldown period before they can be used again. Furthermore, each player slowly builds up a meter towards their character's "ultimate" skill; this meter builds up over time but can build up faster for defeating opponents or performing other beneficial tasks for their team such as healing other team members. Once ready, the player can use this skill at any time which may last for a few seconds (such as increased attack strength or immunity to attacks) or be a single powerful action (such as resurrecting any recently-fallen team members), after which they then must wait for the meter to fill up again. Opposing players will be alerted to the use of this ultimate ability by an exclamation from the character, often in the character's native language; for example, gunslinger McCree will call out "It's high noon" as the player engages the ultimate ability to target multiple visible enemies and deal lethal damage to those still in sight. This gives opposing players a brief moment to try to take cover or respond appropriately.</p>
		<p>Before you begin a game of Overwatch, you’ll need to choose a hero to play.</p>
		<p>Maybe controlling a cannon-toting, genetically-engineered ape from the moon appeals to you. Or, you might prefer zipping around as a teleporting, time-traveling freedom fighter. Who do you want to be?</p>
		<p>In Overwatch, heroes do battle in diverse locations around the world. From the technological marvel of Numbani to the manufacturing powerhouse of Volskaya, each map has a unique layout and specific win conditions that your team must meet in order to secure victory.</p>
		<p>As you play games of Overwatch, you’ll gain levels, unlocking new customization options to make your heroes look and sound unique! Customize your characters in the Hero Gallery (accessible from the main menu).</p>
		<p>When you accomplish a feat of persistence or talent, you’ll unlock a commemorative badge of honor. You can view a detailed breakdown of your achievements and trophies (along with your experience level and play style) and share them with your friends from the Career Overview pane of the main menu</p>
		<p>Joining up with random players or filling out a group with AI-controlled heroes can be an extremely fun way to experience Overwatch, but one of the most rewarding ways to play is by grouping up with your friends.</p>
		<p>Choose your hero and clash on the battle fields of tomorrow. Bend time, defy physics, and wield extraordinary powers in the ultimate team-based shooter.</p>
		<p>Abilities are the unique powers and gear Overwatch’s heroes use to defeat their opponents, protect their teammates and move around maps—they’re the key to winning a match</p>
